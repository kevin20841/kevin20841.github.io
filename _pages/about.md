I'm Kevin Su, a recent graduate from Stanford University, where I studied music composition and computer science theory.

My main compositional interests include exploring the limits of sound and timbre. Some composers I enjoy/are inspired by include Scelsi, Murail, Grisey, Brigitta Muntendorf, Katherine Balch, Mark Applebaum, Liza Lim, and George Lewis. At Stanford, I was extremely fortunate to study music composition with Prof. Francois Rose. I am also thankful to Hans Kretz and Mark Applebaum for inspiring me tremendously.

In computer science, I'm interested in learning theory, complexity theory, and algorithmic fairness/justice.
