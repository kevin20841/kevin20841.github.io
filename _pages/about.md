I'm Kevin Su, a masters student currently studying computer science theory at Stanford University. In computer science, I'm broadly interested in learning theory, complexity theory, and algorithmic fairness. 

I also enjoy playing classical piano and writing music. My main compositional interests include exploring the limits of sound and timbre. I gravitate most towards music written in the "spectral" style. Some of my favorite contermporary composers include Giacinto Sclesi, Gerard Grisey, Tristan Murail, and Horaţiu Rădulescu. At Stanford, I am extremely fortunate to study music composition with Prof. Francois Rose.
