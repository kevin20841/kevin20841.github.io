    - title: Looking Out the Airplane Window, for Clarinet Quartet (2022)
        - As the title suggests, this piece was inspired by the view when looking out an airplane window. I fly often between Stanford and Maryland. Every time I do so, I see the rugged rocky mountains, then the beautiful plains of the Midwest, all dyed by the colors of the setting sun. The beginning of this piece emulates the noise of an airplane in flight. As the piece progresses, the airplane sounds melt away into those beautiful colors that frame the window of the Airplane.

    - title: Sounds of Rusting Metal, for Wind Quintet
      year: 2021

        - Every sound in Sounds of Rusting Metal is derived from a particular rusty metal door, which serves as the main inspiration for this piece. Some of these sounds include for example the door creaking open slowly, or the door being slammed shut.  I was especially captivated by the range of rich timbres this door could create. Inspired by these resonances, I created a short acousmatic sketch that edited and combined these sounds to form even richer timbres. Present in the sketch is a sort of timbral counterpoint that features stretched out versions of the original source sounds. The final acoustic piece is a reaction to the sketch, in the sense that it is a (very) loose interpretation/transcription of the sketch to a Woodwind Quintet. The disparate musical material that constitutes this piece is connected on two metaphorical levels, both in source and by the sketch I wrote. Writing dissimilar material that deeply linked in a way that is not immediately audible is especially compelling to me.

    - title: A Meditation of Two Paintings by Clyfford Still, for Pierrot Ensemble
      year: 2020

        - My inspiration for writing A Meditation on Two Paintings by Clyfford Still was twofold. First, I was inspired by the two titular paintings, PH-385 and PH-950. Second, I wanted to explore the concept of making timbre the main musical focus in my writing. To help me do so, I wrote a computerized tool that given an arbitrary input sound, outputs an orchestration whose timbre best approximates that of the input sound. I fed computer generated sounds inspired by the two paintings into this Orchestration Engine to obtain various pitch material, which I utilized when writing the piece. Additionally, I based ratios of the timing between different sections in the piece on ratios present in both paintings. The result, I hope, is something ethereal that evokes a memory of the viewing of the two paintings.

    - title: Three Frames of Mind, for String Quartet
      year: 2019
      items:
        - Just as the title suggests, Three Frames of Mind for String Quartet represents three moods, each of which is a timbral transformation of the same material. The first is filled with gnarly string glissandi punctuated by short bursts of energy. The second is slower and more consonant, featuring many string harmonics. It is quiet and introspective, compared to the aggressive opening section. The second section erupts into a third slower and more somber mood, which finally arrives at an ambiguous ending that never fully answers the questions posed in the beginning.
